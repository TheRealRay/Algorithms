/*
 * Binary tree which satisfies heap ordering property.
 * min-heap property: value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of the parent,
 * min value at root.
 * max-heap property: value of each node is less than or equal to the value of the parent,
 * max value at root.
 * In a heap, the highest or lowest priority is stored at the root. Not a sorted structure.
 * Since it is a binary tree, it has smallest possible height, a heap with N nodes has O(logN) height.
 * Useful DS when you need to remove the object with lowest or heightest priority.
 * Often used to implement a priority queue.
